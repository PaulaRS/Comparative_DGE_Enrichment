## Description

This repository contains the Rmd-scripts ([`scripts/`](scripts/)) used to generate ([`results`](results/)). The aim of this project was to study the transcriptomic responses of adult and juvenile _Atlanta ariejansseni_ to past, present and future ocean chemistry.

Reads used in this study were deposited at NCBI BioProject PRJNA742523. The Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession GJHI00000000. Formatted input-files are available upon request.

The included code was ran in R version 4.0.4.

## File description
